#Overview

Major applications of RNA-seq data include studies of how the transcriptome is modulated at the levels of gene expression and RNA processing, and how these events are related to cellular identity, environmental condition, and/or disease status. While many excellent tools have been developed to analyze RNA-seq data, these generally have limited efficacy for annotating 3' UTRs. Existing assembly strategies often fragment long 3' UTRs ( illustrated below, left), and importantly, no _de-novo_ (reference annotation independent) transcript assembly of the algorithms in popular use can identify tandem 3' UTR isoforms generated by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) using only RNA-seq data (below, right). Consequently, it is often not possible to identify patterns of differential APA using existing assembly tools.

To address these limitations, we have developed Isoform Structural Change Model (IsoSCM),  a new method for transcript assembly that incorporates change-point analysis to improve the 3' UTR annotation process. If we assume that sequenced reads are distributed proportional to isoform abundance, the boundaries of transcription will be marked by a change in the level of coverage. In instances where short and long isoforms are co-expressed there can be a “step-like” pattern of coverage at the boundary of the nested exon model. To identify terminal exon boundaries, we thus seek _change-points_ that mark transitions in RNA-seq coverage, as illustrated below.

Real RNA-seq data contains biases that can cause the sampling of reads across the transcript body to deviate from a uniform distribution. These biases typically cause short segments of the transcript to be sequenced at a lower frequency than the rest of the transcript, resulting in a local drop in the level of coverage. The conventional (unconstrained) change-point detection procedure identifies these local drops in coverage as distinct segments. However, in the context of annotating transcripts we wish to disregard these local aberrations as they do not correspond to terminal exon boundaries. In order to minimize the effect of local biases on transcript model inference we introduce additional constraints to distinguish localized changes from change-points that mark a sustained decrease in the level of coverage. The difference between constrained and unconstrained formulations is contrasted using a toy example below. 

![constrained changepoint image](./constrained_changepoints.png)

We estimate relative usage of a polyadenylation site by considering the read density in the segments up and downstream of a change-point, such that 

usage = 1 - ( cov<sub>dn</sub> / cov<sub>up</sub> )

where cov<sub>dn/up</sub> are estimates of read density downstream/upstream of a change point. In addition to identifying change-points that mark the boundaries of 3'UTRs, IsoSCM can also be used to estimate the relative usage of 3'UTR isoforms, and identify sites with differential usage between two conditions. Conveniently, the change-point detection framework used by IsoSCM can also be used to identify differential usage of tandem 3' UTRs between two samples by performing a joint segmentation, as illustrated below. 

![differential image](./differential_usage.png)

The resulting joint segmentation can be used to quantitate differential usage of tandem 3'UTR isoforms. For the example shown above we can calculate _cov<sub>up</sub>_ and _cov<sub>dn</sub>_, the level of coverage in the segments up and downstream of the identified change-point, and use these quantities to define differential site usage in each tissue:

usage<sub>brain</sub> = 1 - ( cov<sub>downstream,brain</sub> / cov<sub>upstream,brain</sub> ) &cong; 0.68

usage<sub>liver</sub> = 1 - ( cov<sub>downstream,liver</sub> / cov<sub>upstream,liver</sub> ) &cong; 0.91

&Delta;usage<sub>brain-liver</sub> = usage<sub>brain</sub>-usage<sub>liver</sub> &cong; -0.23

As for the example above, polyadenylation sites that are differentially used between a pair of conditions will be marked by a change-point that has a non-zero _&Delta;usage_.

The functions of IsoSCM described above are performed by the _assemble_, _enumerate_, _compare_ commands, detailed below.

#Running IsoSCM

##_assemble_ command

```
java -Xmx2048m -jar IsoSCM.jar assemble [optional arguments]
```

Taking a BAM file as input, the _assemble_ command will construct a splice-graph of exons, and segment terminal exons using the constrained change-point detection procedure. The minimal arguments to run the _assemble_ command require the BAM file, a base-name for generated output files, and the strandedness of the RNA-seq data. IsoSCM is compatible BAM files generated by many short read mappers, and only requires that spliced reads include the _XS_ flag specifying the inferred strandedness of the spliced read. IsoSCM is a Java application, and requires a JRE version >=1.6 to be [installed](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). We recommend running IsoSCM with at least 2GB of memory via the java _-Xmx_ argument, although should be increased as necessary if _OutOfMemoryError_ exceptions are encountered.

Required arguments:
```
          -bam                    BAM file to be assembled
          
          -base                   The output basename. This will be used as the
                                  prefix for output files.
                                  
          -s                      the strandedness, can be "reverse_forward" or
                                  "unstranded"
```

IsoSCM has a number of optional arguments with default values pertaining to either splice-graph assembly or change-point detection.

                                  Default: 20
```

If the BAM file to process is called _brain.bam_ and the sample was sequenced with the stranded dUTP protocol, the minimal call to IsoSCM _assemble_ would look like 

```
java -Xmx2048m -jar IsoSCM.jar assemble -bam brain.bam -base brain -s reverse_forward
```


##_enumerate_ command

```
java -Xmx2048m -jar IsoSCM.jar enumerate [arguments]
```

Taking a splice-graph generated by the _assemble_ command as input, the _enumerate_ command will list transcript isoforms that are compatible with the splice graph. Since the splice-graph may imply a large number of isoforms, there is a parameter to specify the maximum number of isoforms that will be reported for a single transcript. Loci with more than this number of isoforms are reported as "skipped". This function is <b>not required</b> for assessing differential 3'UTR isoform usage, and is provided as a means to visualize assembled models.

Required arguments:
```
         -max_isoforms            loci with more than this number of isoforms will be
                                  skipped
         -x                       configuration XML file from the assembly step

```

##_compare_ command

```
java -Xmx2048m -jar IsoSCM.jar compare [arguments]
```

Taking the splice-graphs generated by the _assemble_ for two samples as input, the _compare_ command performs joint segmentation of the terminal exons of coexpressed transcripts, and reports the differential usage of each identified change-point.

Required arguments:
```
          -base                   The output basename. This will be used as the
                                  prefix for output files.
          -x1                     XML configuration file for the assembly step from sample 1
          -x2                     XML configuration file for the assembly step from sample 2
```

Optional arguments:
```
          -dir                    The output directory
                                  Default: ./compare
```
